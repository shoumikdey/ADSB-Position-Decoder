# ADSB-Position-Decoder
Decodes ADS-B Positional Frames with Downlink Format 17

This program takes two frames as an input and displays the geographical positional coordinates of the aircraft.
This is the airborne position and not the surface position.
NOTE: The last input will be considered as the latest frame for decoding the position.
